# FedHAR-UCI: Federated Learning on UCI HAR Dataset

This project demonstrates federated learning for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using the UCI HAR Dataset and the Flower framework with PyTorch. You can experiment with three model types:

- **DNN:** A deep neural network using computed features (561-dimensional vectors).
- **CNN:** A convolutional network using raw inertial signals.
- **RNN:** An LSTM-based network using raw inertial signals.
